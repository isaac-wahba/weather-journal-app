# Weather-Journal App Project

## Scope
An asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. It is a part of Udacity's Nanodegree of Professional Frontend Developer, a scholarship by Egypt FWD. 

## Code info
Server side code is built by NodeJs and Express framework on `server.js` file. Main client side code is built in `website/app.js` file by JavaScrips (ES6). You can see `index.html` for element references, and styled by CSS in `style.css`.

## To run the project
On the terminal, use the command `node server.js`, then open the html file on the browser with `localhost:8000` or any port you prefer (but make sure to edit it in the server code).
